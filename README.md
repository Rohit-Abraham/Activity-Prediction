**About**
Human Activity Recognition - HAR - has emerged as a key research area in the last years and is gaining increasing attention by the pervasive computing research community (see picture below, that illustrates the increasing number of publications in HAR with wearable accelerometers), especially for the development of context-aware systems. There are many potential applications for HAR, like elderly monitoring, lifelog systems for monitoring energy expenditure and for supporting weight-loss programs, and digital assistants for weight lifting exercises. The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which the exercise was performed based on the data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants
